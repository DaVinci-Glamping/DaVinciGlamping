    <h2>From Struggle to Renaissance</h2>
    <p>
      This project is not just a business — it’s a rebirth. Da Vinci Glamping was born from the need to escape a life of financial stress, metal factories, and impossible schedules. It’s about rewriting our family’s destiny and offering our son Leonardo a future filled with possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by the genius of the past and the technologies of tomorrow, our goal is to build something extraordinary: a place of beauty, peace, and inspiration, where guests disconnect from chaos and reconnect with the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every dome, every trail, every light at night — it’s all designed to serve the people, just like tech should. Welcome to the fusion of nature and innovation.
